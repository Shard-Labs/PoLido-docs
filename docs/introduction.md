# Introduction

## Lido for Polygon

Lido for Polygon is a DAO governed liquid staking protocol for Polygon PoS chain. It allows users to stake their ERC20 MATIC tokens 
on Ethereum mainnet and immediately get the representation of their share in the form of stMATIC token without maintaining 
staking infrastructure. Users will get staking rewards and still be able to control their stMATIC tokens.MATIC tokens will 
be delegated across validators that are registered and accepted by the DAO inside Lido for Polygon protocol.

Node operators don't have direct access over the delegated assets. 
They are just providing infrastructure and getting rewards in return. 
Assets are controlled by Lido for Polygon contracts exclusively.

The goal is to help with Polygon decentralization and integrate stMATIC with the variety of protocols and DeFi 
applications on Ethereum mainnet and Polygon PoS chain.

## How Lido for Polygon works
From the user perspective, Lido for Polygon user interface will be accessible at https://polygon.lido.fi.

The Lido for Polygon protocol receives submitted MATIC tokens, calculates the current ratio between MATIC and stMATIC tokens 
and sends that amount of stMATIC to the user. Since stMATIC is a non-rebasable token, user will always have the same 
amount. During time, while rewards are accumulated, the value of stMATIC token increases. MATIC tokens are then 
delegated across Polygon validators that are part of Lido for Polygon protocol.

Accumulated rewards are redistributed once a day between node operators (5%), Lido DAO (5%) and the rest (90%) is 
re-delegated.

Upon withdrawal, user submits his stMATIC tokens, receives a NFT token as a voucher for MATIC token claim after the 
un-bonding period (approximately 9 days).

After the un-bonding period, user will be able to submit his NFT to Lido for Polygon, NFT gets burned and user receives his MATIC.
