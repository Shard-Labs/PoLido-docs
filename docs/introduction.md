# Introduction

The Lido Polygon Liquid Staking Protocol allows its users to earn staking rewards for their staked Matic without locking Matic or maintaining staking infrastructure.

Users can deposit Matic to the Lido smart contracts and receive stMatic tokens in return. The smart contract then stakes tokens with the DAO-picked node operators.

Unlike staked Matic, the stMatic tokens are free from the limitations associated with a lack of liquidity and can be transferred at any time. Main difference between stEth and stMatic token is that the stMatic is non-rebaseable ERC-20 token.
