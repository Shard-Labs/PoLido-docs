# Fees

Validation rewards that Lido for Polygon receives are split into four parts:

- 90% of all the rewards gets restaked on the Lido for Polygon validators.
- Remaining 10% gets split into 3 parts:
  - 25% goes to the DAO
  - 50% gets split up across all the operators
  - 25% goes to the insurance

All fees are distributed in the form of Matic. The fee percentages are set by the Lido DAO. The fee percentages are stored on-chain.
