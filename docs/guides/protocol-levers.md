# Protocol levers

The protocol provides a number of settings controllable by the DAO. Modifying each of them requires
the caller to have a specific permission. After deploying the DAO, all permissions belong to the DAO
`Voting` app, which can also manage them. This means that, initially, levers can only be changed by
the DAO voting, and other entities can be allowed to do the same only as a result of the voting.

All existing levers are listed below, grouped by the contract.

### A note on upgradeability

The following contracts are upgradeable by the DAO voting:

- [`StMatic`](/contracts/StMatic)
- [`NodeOperatorsRegistry`](/contracts/node-operators-registry)

Upgradeability is implemented by the Aragon kernel and base contracts. To upgrade an app, one needs
the `dao.APP_MANAGER_ROLE` permission provided by Aragon. All upgradeable contracts use the
[Unstructured Storage pattern] in order to provide stable storage structure across upgrades.

## [StMatic](/contracts/StMatic)

### Fees

The entity fee for `_daoFee`, `_operatorsFee`, `_insuranceFee`, all expressed in % that sum up to `100%`.

- Mutator: `setFees(uint8 _daoFee, uint8 _operatorsFee, uint8 _insuranceFee)`
  - Permission required: `DAO`
- Accessor: `entityFees() returns (
  {
     uint8 dao;
     uint8 operators;
     uint8 insurance;
  }
)`

The fee is taken on staking rewards and distributed between the treasury, the insurance fund, and
node operators.

### Pausing

- Mutators: `togglePause()`
  - Permission required: `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`
- Accessor: `paused() returns (bool)`

When paused, `StMatic` doesn't accept user submissions, doesn't allow user withdrawals and reward distribution.
No token actions (burning, transferring, approving transfers and changing allowances) are allowed. 
The following transactions revert:

- calls to `submit(uint256)`;
- calls to `requestWithdraw(uint256)`;
- calls to `delegate()` 
- calls to `claimTokens(uint256)`;
- calls to `distributeRewards()`

- Mutator: `addOperator(string memory _name, uint8 address _rewardAddress, bytes memory _signerPubkey)`
  - Permission required: `DAO_ROLE`

### Removing a node operator

A node operator can be removed from the registry by calling this function. Operators removed from protocol donâ€™t
take part in fee distribution.

- Mutator: `removeOperator(uint256 _operatorId)`
  - Permission required: `REMOVE_OPERATOR_ROLE`

### Unstaking a node operator

A node operator can be unstaked from the protocol by the DAO. The DAO can withdraw delegated tokens from an unstaked 
node operator. 

- Mutator: `unstake(uint256 _operatorId)`
  - Permission required: `DAO_ROLE`

### Maximum delegate limit

The maximum delegate limit can be changes by the DAO. This determines how much is delegated to each node operator.
The new maximum delegate limit must be less than 10Billion.
